A plugin for Minecraft 1.16.5 that allows server owners to set the amount of hunger food items give to players. There are seven different inventories that the server owner can put food inside of. Then, each inventory can be configured to give the player a certain amount of hunger when a food inside one of those inventories is eaten.
